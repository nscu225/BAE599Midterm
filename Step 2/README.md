Step 2 - Data cleaning and preprocessing

This folder contains the preprocessing script and artifacts for preparing the dataset for yield-per-acre trend analysis.

Files:
- analysis_step2.py : Python script that reads raw CSV, filters to yield rows, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, scales numeric features (if scikit-learn is installed), flags outliers, and saves the cleaned dataset plus a changelog.
- changelog.txt : Generated by the script; documents each change and rationale.
- cleaned_yield_data.csv : Output cleaned dataset (generated when script runs).
- requirements.txt : dependencies for running the script.

How to run:

python3 "Step 2/analysis_step2.py"

Notes:
- The script expects the raw CSV `US-Rice-Acreage-Production-and-yield copy.csv` to be in the repository root.
- If scikit-learn is not installed, the script will still run but will skip numeric scaling; install scikit-learn to enable scaling and save the scaler object.
